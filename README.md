# Staytus Assignment

This project is comprised of three main folders, each corresponding to a section of the assignment:

1. **state-manager**: A TypeScript state manager with functionalities like async middleware (Mastery in state management).
2. **starwars-utilities**: Utility functions to interact with the Star Wars API (Mastery in Promise)
3. **reptile-planets-example**: A UI demonstrating the use of the above two libraries (Mastery in CSS)

## Notes

- The project is live and can be viewed [here](https://erfan93na.github.io/staytus-assignment/).
- Despite the assignment description, there wasn't any planet that had a non-empty films array and at least one resident whose species was "reptile". So, the planets selected for this demo have films and residents from "artificial" species.
